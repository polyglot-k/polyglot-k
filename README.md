## Introduction

I am a **backend engineer** who enjoys tackling **new challenges**. While I have not participated extensively, I continuously **contribute to open source projects**, striving to write **clean, efficient, and maintainable code**. My contributions to **Spring Framework** and **Spring Data JPA** reflect my focus on improving **code readability, performance, and memory efficiency**.

Beyond coding, I am passionate about **fostering a positive developer culture**. As a [**Google Developer Group on Campus (GDGoC) KNU, 5th term Organizer**](https://github.com/orgs/GDG-on-Campus-KNU), I have **organized community events, shared knowledge, and mentored other developers**.
